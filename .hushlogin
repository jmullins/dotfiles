# If the file ~/.hushlogin or /etc/hushlogins exists, then a "quiet" login is performed
# (this disables the checking of mail and the printing of the last login time and message of the day).
# Otherwise, if /var/log/lastlog exists, the last login time is printed (and the current login is recorded).
